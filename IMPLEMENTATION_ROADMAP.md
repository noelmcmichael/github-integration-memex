## Quick Start: Phase 1 Implementation

Let's start with the most impactful solution for your environment consistency issues:

### 1. Docker Development Environment Template
Create standardized Docker setup for web apps with:
- Consistent Node.js/Python versions
- Database containers
- Environment variable management
- Hot reloading for development

### 2. GCP Deployment Template
Pre-configured Cloud Run setup with:
- Automated container builds
- Environment-specific configurations
- Health checks and monitoring
- Auto-scaling configuration

### 3. Environment Validation Script
Pre-deployment checks for:
- All required environment variables
- Database connectivity
- External API availability
- Build dependencies

Would you like me to start implementing the Docker development environment template? This would immediately solve your environment consistency issues and provide a foundation for the rest of the roadmap.
